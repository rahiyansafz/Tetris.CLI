# Tetris.CLI

## ## This is a console-based Tetris game implemented in C#. The game is played on a 10x20 grid where tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen and the player can move and rotate them to form complete horizontal lines. Once a line is completed, it disappears, and the player's score increases. The game ends when the tetrominoes reach the top of the screen and there is no more room for new pieces.

## The game features a randomized block generator and an option to hold the current block. The player can also speed up the falling speed of the block or pause the game at any time.

## This project demonstrates the use of basic C# syntax and logic to create a functional game.
